    The program should start by displaying a welcome message and explaining the rules of the game.
    The program should randomly select a word from a predefined list of words (you can create your own list).
    The program should display the word as a series of underscores, representing the unknown letters. For example, if the word is "hangman," it should be displayed as "_ _ _ _ _ _ _."
    The player should be allowed to guess letters one at a time.
    The program should check if the guessed letter is in the word. If it is, the program should reveal the positions of the guessed letter in the word.
    The program should keep track of the letters guessed so far and display them to the player.
    The player should have a limited number of guesses (e.g., 6) before they lose the game.
    If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before running out of guesses, the program should display a congratulatory message and end the game.
    If the player runs out of guesses before guessing the word correctly, the program should reveal the word and display a message indicating that the player lost.
